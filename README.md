## Deep Correlation Multimodal Style Transfer

Deep Correlation Multimodal Style Transfer (DeCorMST) is a neural style transfer network that produces multiple generated output from a single pair of content and style images.

This repo will provides our implementation in [One2ManyNeuralStyleTransfer.ipynb] and code for quantitatively evaluating performance of generated images in [Quantative_Style]

Here is some example results:
